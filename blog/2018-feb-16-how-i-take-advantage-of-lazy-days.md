## How I Take Advantage of Lazy Days

<!---
Problem: some days, it's hard to start working
- Productivity levels change every day
- On a good day, can work hard
- On a lazy day, can't get anything done
- Tasks seem too big to start
- Especially a problem with large research problems
- Don't want to lose track of big picture, but can be paralyzing
--->
My productivity can totally change from day to day. On a great day, I can focus on my work for hours and even lose track of time. On a bad day, though, I might struggle to get anything done. Some days, I find myself staring at my to-do list without wanting to work on anything. This has become a bigger problem for me in grad school, where I'm constantly thinking about my research: trying to decide what to do next on a multi-month project can be paralyzing.

<!---
Solution: enable the good days
- Removing low productivity days is hard
- Using them to my advantage is easier
- Get the easy, tedious steps done
- When I feel productive again, easier to jump straight into work
- I think of this as "pre-starting" my work
- Do the setup first so that I can do the real work later
- Often feel happily surprised that these things are finished
--->
It's hard to find a way to get rid of these lazy days. Instead, it's much easier to use them to my advantage. When I have a slow day, I use it to get the easy, tedious parts of my work done. Then, when I feel productive again, it's easy for me to jump straight into my work again. I think of this as a way of pre-starting my work: I get the boring setup out of the way so that I can do the real work later. Sometimes, I even feel happily surprised that all of the setup is done already. 

Here are some of the things I do on lazy days:

<!---
Busy work:
- Repetitive things that need to get done eventually
- Answer emails
- Paperwork
- Answer bug reports/forum questions
- These might take a while, but most of them are small
--->
**Busy work:**
Slow days are helpful for finishing administrative work, like getting up-to-date on my emails or finishing paperwork. I found this type of work most helpful when I was working as a software engineer. For me, answering bug reports or forum questions could be a big time sink, taking time out of my productive days. Taking some time to deal with them thoroughly is a good use of an otherwise slow day.

<!---
Small tasks:
- Easy assignments
- Maybe just one question
- Prepare for teaching: review slides, test assignments
- These are usually more well-defined pieces of work
- Easier to deal with on slow days
- One less distraction for later
--->
**Small tasks:**
These days are also good for finishing some smaller, self-contained tasks. When I'm taking classes, a slow day is great for getting an easy assignment done. Even if this just means solving one question, getting it out of the way is helpful. They're also good for preparing for teaching: reviewing slides or testing assignments is pretty straightforward. These kinds of tasks are easier for me to deal with on a slow day.  They're smaller, well-defined problems, they're easy to start, and they have a clear end point. Getting them out of the way also means that I won't have to stop to finish them later, taking away one more distraction from a productive day.

Plan:
- Step back and look at bigger picture instead of working on 
- Brainstorm about large problems
- Break down into smaller tasks
- Write future to-do lists
- Helpful for making the larger problems feel smaller
--->
**Planning:**
Another good distraction is planning my next steps long-term projects. Instead of working directly on moving forward, I find it helpful to use these days to step back and think about my direction for the next weeks or months. This gives me a chance to brainstorm and come up with new ideas or solutions. It's also a good opportunity to think about the next steps in my research and write out detailed to-do lists for them. Breaking down my problems into detailed lists like this can also be motivating, making my work feel more manageable on a lazy day.

<!---
Set up:
- Lay out documents (for assignments/reports/papers)
- Might take some time (Latex templates for papers
- Makes it easy to dive right into writing later
- Lay out code 
- Same ideas as writing
--->
**Setting up:** 
Finally, one of the most useful tasks I've found is setting up my documents for later. When I have an assignment, report, or paper to write, making a template document with all of the right formatting can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours (depending on how many Latex files are involved). This process is a huge help to me - it gets the busy set-up work out of the way and lets me focus completely on the writing later. The same idea applies to writing new software. Installing packages, setting up a repository, and laying out a sketch of my code are often pretty easy to do, and getting this work done early means that I can jump straight into writing code later.

Helpful to have a to-do list with a bunch of these
- When I don't feel like working on the project, rattle off a few of these instead
- Makes me feel productive on a "lazy" day 
- Especially useful if I can finish a large _number_ of things, even if the amount of work is small
- Positive feedback to get back to being productive again
--->
I find it helpful to keep a bunch of these tasks on my to-do list. When I don't feel like focusing on my long-term projects, I'll switch to these easier jobs and finish a few of them instead. On top of finishing some busy work, doing this makes me feel productive on a slow day. This effect is especially useful if I can check off a large number of items on my to-do list. Even if the total amount of work is small, getting it done can start a positive feedback loop, helping me get back to feeling energetic and productive.
