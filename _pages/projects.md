## University of Waterloo
I am currently a Master's student at the University of Waterloo. I study crowdsourcing systems and how to make them more effective. In particular, I am interested in making crowdsourcing tasks where multiple workers collaborate in real time. I am currently researching ways to pay workers fairly for working on a team. My research might be best described as computer supported cooperative work, understanding how humans work together and using computer systems to take advantage of this cooperative work.

I work with [CrowdCurio](http://crowdcurio.com/) for my crowdsourcing studies, and my research is closely related to other graduate students' work on CrowdCurio (including [Will Callaghan](http://willcallaghan.ca/), [Mike Schaekermann](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mschaeke/bio-and-research/), and [Alex Williams](http://acw.io/)).

## Dalhousie University
While I was studying Computer Engineering at Dalhousie, I had a chance to work on a wide range of projects. Here are a few of them:

### ChipWhisperer
<table class="image-text"><tr>
<td>
At <a href="http://newae.com/">NewAE Technology</a>, I helped develop the ChipWhisperer toolchain. My work included:
<ul>
<li> Creating embedded software, including C and Verilog firmware for the ChipWhisperer and a variety of encryption routines for various target devices </li>
<li> Developing two large Python programs to control the ChipWhisperer hardware and analyze recorded data </li>
<li> Designing a remote analysis system, including high-performance statistical analysis methods and a client/server web API</li>
<li> Writing tutorials and training material on the theoretical background and features in the ChipWhisperer </li>
<li> Maintaining the public Github repository, managing releases, issue reports, and pull requests</li>
</ul>

While working at NewAE, I co-authored a paper with [Colin O'Flynn](http://colinoflynn.com/) discussing the implications of side-channel analysis on automotive system design (to appear in the [SAE International Journal of Transportation Cybersecurity and Privacy](https://www.sae.org/publications/collections/content/e-journal-11/) in March 2018).

### Jeff Dahn Research Group

I spent two 4 month terms with the <a href="https://www.dal.ca/diff/dahn.html">Jeff Dahn Research Group</a> - one funded by an NSERC DREAMS scholarship, and one for my first co-op term at Dalhousie. In the lab, I built a frequency response analyzer (FRA) which combined impedance measurement equipment with ordinary battery cyclers, testing cells automatically throughout the cycling process. The equipment gave researchers a method to test a variety of battery chemistries quickly and easily. <br/><br/>

Data from my FRA system was <a href="http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/162/6/A1046.short">published</a> in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society.
