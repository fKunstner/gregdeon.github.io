## University of Waterloo
When I start studying at Waterloo, I'll update this page with details about my research. Until then, take a look at [Edith Law's work on crowdsourcing](http://edithlaw.ca/research.html) and [Kate Larson's work on multi-agent systems](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~klarson/publications.html).


## Dalhousie University
While I was studying Computer Engineering at Dalhousie, I had a chance to work on a wide range of projects. Here are a few of them:

### ChipWhisperer
<table class="image-text"><tr>
<td>
At <a href="http://newae.com/">NewAE Technology</a>, I helped develop the ChipWhisperer toolchain. My work included:
<ul>
<li> Creating embedded software, including C and Verilog firmware for the ChipWhisperer and a variety of encryption routines for various target devices </li>
<li> Developing two large Python programs to control the ChipWhisperer hardware and analyze recorded data </li>
<li> Writing tutorials and training material on the theoretical background and features in the ChipWhisperer </li>
</ul>

### Jeff Dahn Research Group

I spent two 4 month terms with the <a href="https://www.dal.ca/diff/dahn.html">Jeff Dahn Research Group</a> - one funded by an NSERC DREAMS scholarship, and one for my first co-op term at Dalhousie. In the lab, I built a frequency response analyzer (FRA) which combined impedance measurement equipment with ordinary battery cyclers, testing cells automatically throughout the cycling process. The equipment gave researchers a method to test a variety of battery chemistries quickly and easily. <br/><br/>

Data from my FRA system was <a href="http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/162/6/A1046.short">published</a> in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society.
