I'm a Master's student in the [David R. Cheriton School of Computing Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo. I am co-supervised by [Edith Law](http://edithlaw.ca/) and [Kate Larson](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~klarson/). I'll be starting my degree at Waterloo in September 2017.

Before Waterloo, I earned a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from Dalhousie University's [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/engineering/electrical.html). Through the engineering co-op program, I worked for several groups:
* I designed and built a Frequency Response Analyzer (FRA) for the [Jeff Dahn Research Group](https://www.dal.ca/diff/dahn.html), which was used to [research novel Li-ion battery chemistries](http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/162/6/A1046.short)
* I researched acoustic models for head impacts with the [Dalhousie Department of Engineering Mathematics](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/engineering/math-internetworking.html)
* I developed inexpensive tools for side channel analysis with [NewAE Technology](http://newae.com/)
